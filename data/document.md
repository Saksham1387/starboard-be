Yes, the document provides key zoning-related insights for 280 Richards Street in Red Hook, Brooklyn. Here's a summary of the zoning context:

### **Zoning Designation Insight**

* The property is used as a **logistics facility for Amazon**, which falls under **industrial and last-mile distribution** use.
* The memorandum notes:

  > *“Amazon last-mile use is exclusively permitted in **M or C9 zones**.”*
  > This suggests that **280 Richards is zoned M (Manufacturing) or C9 (Commercial with specific industrial use provisions)**.

### **Regulatory Context**

* As of **May 2024**, new NYC industrial zoning regulations require:

  > *“Last-mile facilities to apply for a special permit from the City Planning Commission.”*
  > This **adds restrictions** and **limits speculative development**, increasing the value of existing compliant properties like 280 Richards.

### **Strategic Zoning Implications**

* **High barriers to entry** for logistics/industrial development in Red Hook due to:

  * Zoning constraints (limited M/C9 availability)
  * Residential developers offering premiums for land conversions
  * Special permitting requirements for new facilities
* These factors position 280 Richards as a **rare and valuable industrial asset** in a tightly regulated zone.

If you’d like, I can help identify the exact **zoning map** or **NYC zoning designation (e.g., M1-1, M2-1)** for 280 Richards using public databases or zoning maps. Would you like me to do that?

## 03 market snapshot. (Line 427)

### MISSION CRITICAL LOCATION FOR AMAZON. (Line 432)

#### Red Hook, Brooklyn Offers Unrivaled Last Touch Optionality (Line 436-437)
- 280 Richards offers Amazon the ability to efficiently service the most populous borough (Brooklyn) in New York City (Line 439-440)
- As of Q1 2024, Brooklyn houses over 2.8 million residents, or 31% of New York City's total population (Line 441-443)

#### Unique Access to the New York City Consumer (Line 436-437)
- The Property's strategic Red Hook location covers four of the five most affluent zip codes in Brooklyn (Line 439-440)
- Brooklyn's consumer base is equivalent to that of Chicago's while compromising only a third of Chicago's land area (Line 441-442)
- In general, the New York City Boroughs post the highest density per mile in the United States (Line 443-445)

#### Elite Consumer Base (Line 450)
- The average household income within a two-mile radius is approximately $160,000, including over $30,000 in average annual household spending (Line 452-454)
- The aggregate consumer spending power within a ten-mile radius is over $75 billion with over 2.5 million households projected by 2028, according to CoStar (Line 455-458)

#### Core Infill Location (Line 450)
- Less than five minutes from the Brooklyn Battery Tunnel, providing direct accessibility to Downtown Manhattan (Line 452-453)
- 280 Richards is located within 40 minutes of JFK and LaGuardia Airports (Line 454-456)
- Adjacent to Red Hook Container Terminal, a 65-acre full-service container port with over 2,000 feet of deep water berth (Line 457-460)

## STRONG, RESILIENT MARKET FUNDAMENTALS. (Line 470-471)

#### Local Leasing Momentum and Tenant Demand (Line 474-475)
- Despite moderating leasing totals nationwide, the Brooklyn submarket surrounding 280 Richards stands at approximately 5% vacancy (Line 477-479)
- Borough average taking rents continue to exceed $40 PSF, which includes Class A assets that are older and structurally inferior to 280 Richards (Line 480-483)
- New York City Boroughs posted year-to-date net absorption of 625,000 SF. Over 900,000 SF of Q1 2024 leasing volume in the Boroughs, which was over 70% higher than last year's quarterly average (Line 484-489)

#### Suppressed Supply in Red Hook and Surrounding Boroughs (Line 474-476)
- Key factors that contribute to constrained logistics supply: (Line 478-479)
    - Amazon last-mile use is exclusively permitted in M or C9 zones (Line 481-482)
    - Brooklyn's logistics inventory has declined by more than 6 MSF over the past decade due to commercial/residential conversions. Residential developers' willing to pay 3X premium for land sites (Line 483-488)
    - New industrial permit, introduced in May 2024, mandates last-mile facilities to apply for a special permit from the City Planning Commission, which will restrict future development (Line 489-494)
    - Uncertainty of approval will discourage speculative industrial development, causing an increase in market rents and a decrease in vacancy rates (Line 495-499)

#### Consistent Rise of E-Commerce Fundamentals (Line 474-476)
- Increased consumer reliance on e-commerce is driving demand across the metro for industrial space and logistics facilities (Line 478-481)

## AMAZON NEW YORK METRO STRATEGY. (Line 598-599)

Amazon has rapidly expanded its footprint in the boroughs to service its largest delivery market, the NY Metro Region. (Line 601-602) Prior to 2019, Amazon primarily serviced Manhattan and the surrounding boroughs out of its New Jersey facilities; however, the increase of rapid same-day delivery by consumers has driven Amazon's growth directly into NYC. (Line 602-606) The Boroughs are therefore critical to Amazon's execution on its last mile strategy, which now includes 19 last mile delivery stations and fullfillment centers, and 1 Prime Now facility. (Line 606-609)

Since 2019, Amazon has strategically created a critical mass and now occupies over 7.5 MSF of industrial space within the NY boroughs, including 1.4 MSF at 526-566 Gulf Ave (Staten Island), 770,000 SF at 55-15 Grand Ave (Queens), and 690,000 SF at 2505 Bruckner Blvd (Bronx). (Line 611-615) Approximately 4.1 MSF of the NY footprint is comprised of new construction with unique capabilities such as parking, which was previously unavailble in the existing inventory. (Line 615-618)

### Total SF (Line 622)

|           | Total SF |
| :-------- | :------- |
| NY Boroughs | 7.5 MSF  |
| Proximate NNJ | 9.0 MSF  |
| **Total SF** | **16.5 MSF** |
